          <h3>Jaime Lee Randall<br /><small>Matron of Honor</small></h3>
          <p>She's my bestie. Jaime was there as I broke out of my childhood and has been there for me ever since. She's the most genuine, caring, giving and dependable friend I have. Oh and she's a brilliant musician and artist with vocals that come from someplace holy where lollipops grow on trees and the stars shine all day. If you're lucky she'll belt something out for you!</p>

          <h3>Avra Ackerman<br /><small>Bridesmaid</small></h3>
          <p>Avra and I have been friends since medical school, a surprisingly long time ago. Our friendship started in the cadaver lab and has gained more life every year since then.  Her family adopted me when I was a homeless vagabond during school and now they're stuck with me. Avra is a huge activist for social medicine and justice and is trying to save 99% of the world. </p>

          <p>Yet another love story begun in the cadaver lab, Carrie and I share an appetite for adventure, risk and surgical knives. We have shared many shenanigans and travels together, climbing, skiing and just plain raising hell. We've maintained the trend since her move to Austin, TX and anticipate many more wild times ahead. She's a brilliant and caring OB and womanses doc and I count myself lucky to have her share our day.</p>

          <h3>Amy Hupe<br /><small>Bridesmaid</small></h3>
          <p>Amy is my sister! She is a dedicated mother and wife to yet another of Luke's best friends. What can we say?! He knows how to pick 'em. She has dedicated her life to missions, living in Bangkok for the last 5+ years with her family. Their community center has become a place of refuge and new direction for the trafficked and downtrodden.  She was the first Burnett to tie the knot and now I'm thrilled she'll be able to return from the East with her family to participate in the festivities. The day would not be the same without her!</p>

          <p>That's the short of it. He's the bride's brother and was at one time the groom's roommate. He's been our home away from home and all this would not be possible without his blessing.</p>
